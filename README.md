# How to Start

The entry-point scripts are located in  
[sympnets/scripts](https://github.com/Autumn61q/From_ODEs_to_Neural_ODEs/tree/main/sympnets/scripts).

- **`1order_model_solver.py`** — entry script for the first‑order model and solver  
- **`2order_model_solver.py`** — entry script for the second‑order model and solver  
- **`3order_model_solver.py`** — entry script for the third‑order model and solver  

Use these scripts to reproduce the experimental results or to run new experiments.
